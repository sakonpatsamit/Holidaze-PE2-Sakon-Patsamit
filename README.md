Holidaze is a web application for our Project Exam 2 at Noroff. You can browse, search, create, book, update and delete venues with this application. To create your own venue you have to sign up as a Venue Manager.

The API provided for this application is provided by Noroff.

Holidaze is built as my final exam at Noroff.
